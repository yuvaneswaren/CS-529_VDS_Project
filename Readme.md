# Nonprofit Governance Benchmarks for Chicago (Form 990)

### Project Title  
**Leadership Levers in Nonprofit Governance: Peer Benchmarks for Board Structure & Executive Compensation in Chicago**

---

## Overview

This project builds a **visual analytics tool** that helps nonprofit leaders in Chicago understand how their governance structures compare with peers. Using publicly available IRS Form 990 data, we explore how board size, independence, committee coverage, and executive compensation relate to organizational stability.

The tool turns complex filings into clear visuals that make benchmarking easy and actionable. Users can:

- Explore **peer cohort comparisons** through interactive visualizations.  
- View **organization profile cards** that summarize governance and compensation details.  
- Examine optional **interlock networks** to see shared directors across nonprofits.  
- Export **case briefs** for classroom use or leadership workshops.

Our goal is to make nonprofit governance data more interpretable, trustworthy, and useful for leadership development and research.

---

## Objectives

- Deliver **decision-ready visualizations** for governance benchmarking.  
- Create a **clean data pipeline** that transforms Form 990 filings into analysis-ready tables.  
- Enhance **explainability and trust** with clear rationale for all visual indicators.  
- Support **leadership education** through data-driven insights and case briefs.
